I like the n1mm_view project, but I wanted to add Radio info to it.

This will listen on another UDP port and do stuff with the N1MM data. 


#ToDO
- [x] Listen on a UDP Port for N1MM Radio information
- [x] Format and print to the terminal
- [x] Post the data to MQTT broker
- [x] Get a ESP8266 Reading the data from the MQTT Broker
- [ ] Post the data to multiple MQTT Topics, one for each OpStation
- [ ] Document the esp8266 HW
- [ ] Document usage for others
- [ ] Generate n1mm_view images with Radio Data
